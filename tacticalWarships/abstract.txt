Game: Tactical Warships

ABSTRACT:
Tactical Warships is a modified version of the board game, Battleships. A couple differences in 
Tactical Warships are the sonar feature and the ability to play defensive by moving your ships. 
Since the ships in Battleships are stuck in one spot and when the enemy spots a ship, there is 
no way for strategy to be involved. Tactical Warships changes the way the game plays by 
providing the ability to change the board. In a playerâ€™s defensive phase, their ships are able to
move and in the offensive phase, the player is able to send out a sonar to reveal nearby enemy locations providing more strategy.
locations providing more strategy.
